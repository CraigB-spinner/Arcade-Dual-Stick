**The Box:** Dual Stick box dimensions  
***Wood box*** measures 14½” x 7” x 3” in size, ¾” thick walls -   
wood sides have ¼” deep rabbet ¾” wide butt joints glued, and undersized ¼” rabbet along inside bottom edge to allow 13½” x 6” x ¼” plywood panel to recess in flush. The wood box outside bottom and side edges have ¼ round routered edge.  
***Plexiglass top*** measures 16” x 8” x ⅛” with ¾” overhang each side, except ¼” in rear - box sides cut oversized however, allows for larger stable footprint. (original reason for wood recess near Exit/Play/Coin buttons)
