**The Box:**  
The wood box measures 14½” x 7” x 3” in size, ¾ thick walls - Dual Stick box dimensions;  
wood sides have ¼” deep rabbet ¾” wide butt joints glued, and undersized ¼” rabbet along inside bottom edge to allow 13½” x 6” x ¼” plywood panel to recess in flush. The outside bottom and side edges have ¼ round routered edge.  
Plexiglass top measures 16” x 8” x ⅛” with overhang of ¾” each side except ¼” in rear - oversized cut box sides however, allows for larger footprint.
