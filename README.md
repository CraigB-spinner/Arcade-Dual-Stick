The first Zero Delay Controller is setup in box attached to left Joystick and can be used as player #1 with 
Buttons 1-6(turned CW 'S-pattern'), plus 9-Select(Coin), 10-Start(Play), and 12-Hotkey(Exit). 
The second Zero Delay Controller is setup in box attached to right Joystick without any additional buttons. 
In **Robotron: 2084** control is handled by both Joysticks with use of Coin & Play buttons.<br/>

If you rotate a Sanwa or Seimitsu joystick with micro-switches soldered to a PCB board, the wire harness will not relay proper connection order for expected four directions. The first line below is the standard mounting of 5 pin joysticks with connector exiting lower right corner. There are another three possible orientation to mount such a joystick. My stick two has the harness exit from upper left to aid fitting into the wood box. The result is left/right and up/down directions being flipped on the harness and one side needs to be adjusted. Four connectors other than the Ground are released from plug and re-inserted in new proper location. The modification re-orients the joystick back to proper four directions.

**The Box:** Dual Stick box dimensions  
***Wood box*** measures 14½” x 7” x 3” in size, ¾” thick walls -   
wood sides (top/bottom) have ¼” deep rabbet ¾” wide butt joints glued, and undersized ¼” rabbet along inside bottom edge to allow 13½” x 6” x ¼” plywood panel to recess in flush. The wood box outside bottom and side edges have ¼ round routered edge.  
***Plexiglass top*** measures 16” x 8” x ⅛” with ¾” overhang each side, except ¼” in rear - box sides cut oversized however, allows for larger stable footprint. (original reason for wood recess near Exit/Play/Coin buttons)  
Top attached using seven M4x12mm flat head Phillips screws and M4*8mm threaded wood inserts. Bottom attched with twelve #4 x 1” flat head wood screws every 2-4" apart. 
Each joystick attached with four M4x12mm flat head Phillips screws and M4 serrated flange nuts.  
Final clear coat finish will be applied, a printed insert covering controller & wire clutter to complete project.
